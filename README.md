(Litter)box of a developer ; The discontinued development collection.

---

## Description

This is a collection of things - including hardware and software - that were
modeled, and maybe implemented at a small scale, but had its development
discontinued for one-reason-or-another.

The primary purpose is to keep a historical record of ideas, so that they can be
called back upon and used as reference. The secondary purpose, and why this is
open-source, is to bootstrap and inspire others' ideas.

## Draft

A draft is a model of an idea; in the ballpark of elevator-pitch and pseudocode.
A draft can be found under `doc/<MEDIUM>/<DRAFT>.md` - and contains the "what",
"where", and "why". Some more information may also be included:

- **Features**: api, seperation of concerns, and user-interfaces.
- **Toolchain**: build tools, dependencies, languages, licenses, and security.

## Expo

An expo is an implementation of a [draft](#draft). Not every draft has a expo.
An expo can be found under `src/<MEDIUM>/<DRAFT>/` - and contains build, docs,
and general source files. Some special files may also be included:

- **BUGS.md**: architectural flaws, bugs, and issues.
- **TODO.md**: planned features and relevant notes; can be seen as a roadmap.

> No license information is included. The LICENSE(.md) applies to every expo.

## Review

A draft or expo may be removed if it's degraded, old, or redundant. This is to
improve or maintain the overall quality of the collection.

When removal is being considered, there **may** be a public review process -
a draft or expo is flagged, and reasons-for-removal are disclosed and debated.
